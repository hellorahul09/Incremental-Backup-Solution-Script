# Incremental Backup Solution

A script for automated incremental backups using Python and batch files. This solution maps network drives, runs a Python script to back up files incrementally, and disconnects the drives after the backup.

## Features
- **Incremental Backup**: Copies only new or modified files since the last backup.
- **Supports Network Drives**: Maps drives using batch scripts for seamless network access.
- **Logging**: Logs all backup activities for easy debugging and monitoring.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Network Access**: Ensure the source and destination folders are accessible over the network.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/incremental-backup-solution.git

## Scheduling the Task to Run Automatically (Windows Task Scheduler)

Follow these steps to schedule your `.bat` file for automated execution:

### **Step 1: Open Task Scheduler**
1. Press `Win + S` and search for **Task Scheduler**, then open it.
2. In the left pane, click on **Task Scheduler Library**.

### **Step 2: Create a New Task**
1. In the right pane, click on **Create Task**.
2. In the **General** tab:
   - **Name**: Enter a name for your task (e.g., `Backup Script`).
   - **Description**: Add an optional description (e.g., "Runs the backup batch script daily").
   - **Run whether user is logged on or not**: Select this to ensure the task runs regardless of user login status.
   - **Run with highest privileges**: Check this box if the task requires admin privileges.
   - **Configure for**: Set to your version of Windows (e.g., "Windows 10").

### **Step 3: Set the Trigger**
1. Go to the **Triggers** tab.
2. Click **New**.
3. In the **New Trigger** window:
   - Choose when to start the task (e.g., **Daily**).
   - Set the **Start** date and time.
   - Configure recurrence (e.g., every day, weekly, or a specific schedule).
4. Click **OK** to save the trigger.

### **Step 4: Set the Action**
1. Go to the **Actions** tab.
2. Click **New**.
3. In the **New Action** window:
   - **Action**: Select **Start a Program**.
   - **Program/script**: Enter the full path to your `.bat` file. For example:
     ```
     E:\Backuper\backup_script.bat
     ```
   - Leave **Add arguments** and **Start in** blank unless required.
4. Click **OK** to save the action.

### **Step 5: Test the Task**
1. After creating the task, locate it in the Task Scheduler Library.
2. Right-click on the task and select **Run**.
3. Confirm that the task executes as expected (e.g., check the backup files or logs).

### **Step 6: Enable History and Troubleshooting**
1. Enable task history:
   - In Task Scheduler, right-click **Task Scheduler Library** â†’ **Enable All Tasks History**.
2. View task history for logs in case of errors.

### **Common Issues and Solutions**
- **Mapped Drives Not Found**: If the script relies on mapped drives (e.g., `B:`, `S:`), ensure they are explicitly mapped in the `.bat` file using `net use`.
- **Task Runs but No Output**: Check the **"History"** tab in Task Scheduler or review any logs generated by the `.bat` file.
- **Task Fails with Permission Errors**: Ensure the task is set to **Run with highest privileges** in the General tab.

This guide ensures your `.bat` file will run automatically on a schedule using Windows Task Scheduler. For any questions or issues, refer to the **Issues** section in this repository. ðŸ˜Š
